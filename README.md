# DDNS-Updater-Bash-Script
This script updates IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses in the DNS of your domain through the API URL of your DDNS provider.

# Supported DDNS Providers
- All-Inkl.com
- DuckDNS.org
- Google Domains
  Note: You need to add Google twice if you like to update IPv4 and IPv6 as Google does not offer a method to update both at the same time.
